This file was written for release 1.5.20 of DGD, Dworkin's Game Driver.

DGD is a rewrite from scratch of the LPMud server.  It runs on Windows, MacOS
and many versions of Unix.  The source repository for DGD can be found at:

    https://github.com/dworkin/dgd

DGD's home page is at:

    http://www.dworkin.nl/dgd/

DGD 1.5 modernizes the bytecode VM, drops precompiler support and adds UDP
support.

The 1.5 line of DGD is the last one which is backward compatible with the
snapshot format all the way back to DGD 1.0.86.  Version 1.6 and later can
only restore a snapshot from DGD 1.5.9+.

Alongside DGD, there is Hydra.  Hydra is fully compatible with DGD, but offers
acceleration for multi-core systems.  Hydra also supports JIT compilation,
using the same extension module as DGD 1.6.  Learn more at:

This distribution is organized as follows:

bin		Installation binaries will be created here (Unix).
doc		Documentation, still very incomplete.
mud		A place to put the mudlib.
src		Where the source of DGD resides, and where you issue your
		`make' command on Unix.
src/host/*	Subdirectories for various platform-dependent files.
tmp		The place where temporary files, such as the swap file, are
		created by DGD.

See the file doc/Platforms for help on compiling DGD on various platforms.
Also consult the src/host/*/README file for your platform, if there is one.
