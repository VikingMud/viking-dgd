To compile DGD on Windows you need to have Visual Studio 2010 or later.

Look for it [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com).

You also will need to install GnuWin's Bison.

Look for it [here](https://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/bison.htm).

The location of Bison.exe will need to be added to your path.  It is recommended that you install it to a location with no spaces in the path since bison will not function correctly otherwise.  If you do install to a location such as `c:\program files\gnuwin32`, then you must use the 8.3 form of the path `c:\progra~1\gnuwin32` instead.

DGD for Windows is a console application and should be run just as it is on Unix-type operating systems.
